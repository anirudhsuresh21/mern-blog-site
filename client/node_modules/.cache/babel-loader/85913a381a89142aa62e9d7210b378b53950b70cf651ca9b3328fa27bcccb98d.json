There\\u2019s no question the venture scene has changed meaningfully since Uncork got its start. When firm founder Jeff Clavier launched the firm, he was mostly using his savings to write six-figure checks to founders. Now Clavier and his contemporaries, including Josh Kopelman of First Round Capital and Aydin Senkut of Felicis, collectively oversee billions of dollars in assets. Zooming out, the whole industry has gotten a whole lot bigger. In 2004, venture firms plugged roughly $20 billion into startups. In 2021, that amount reached a comparatively jaw-dropping $350 billion. As the industry\\u2019s scale has changed, numerous rules of the road have changed, too \\u2014 some for better, some for worse, and some because the original rules didn\\u2019t make a lot of sense in the first place. On the eve of Uncork\\u2019s anniversary, we talked with Clavier and his managing partner of many years, Andy McLoughlin, about some of those shifts. At some point, it became completely acceptable for full-time VCs to publicly invest their own money in startups. Previously, institutions funding venture firms wanted partners to focus solely on investing for the firm. Do you recall when things changed? JC: Firms typically have policies to let partners invest in things that aren\\u2019t competitive or that overlap with the firm\\u2019s strategy. Let\\u2019s say you have a friend who starts a company and needs cash; if ever the firm decides to invest in future rounds, then two things: there is a disclosure necessary to [the firm\\u2019s limited partner advisory committee] saying \\u2018FYI, I was an investor in this company, I\\u2019m not the lead, I did not price the deal, there is no funny business where I\\u2019m marking myself up here.\\u2019 Also, some firms may [force] you to sell investment into the round, so you don\\u2019t have a conflict of interest. Okay then, when did it become acceptable to back competing companies? I realize this still isn\\u2019t widely accepted, but it\\u2019s more okay than it once was. I talked this week with an investor that has led later-stage deals in pretty direct HR competitors. Both companies say it\\u2019s fine, but I can\\u2019t help thinking there\\u2019s something wrong with this picture. AM: They\\u2019re probably acting like it\\u2019s fine and they\\u2019ll continue to act that way until it\\u2019s not, and then it\\u2019s going to be a big problem. This is something we take very seriously. If we feel like there\\u2019s any potential conflict, we want to get ahead of it. We\\u2019ll typically say to our own portfolio company, \\u2018Hey, look, we\\u2019re looking at this thing. Do you see this as competitive?\\u2019 We actually had this come up this week. We think it\\u2019s actually [a] very different [type of company], but we wanted to go through the steps and make everybody feel very comfortable.
